## Fix getting stuck on surface intersections

Fix bug that causes the player character to get stuck on
same-height surfaces of two different game objects, whose
areas intersect, when holding both left/right and down
direction keys.

Low priority because the up/down direction keys probably
won't really be enabled in production code anyways.

## Put some useful information into README
